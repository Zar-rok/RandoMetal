# RandoMetal
Simple python script to randomly play a metal music.

[------------------------------------------------------------------]

Make sure you have BeautifulSoup4, Selenium and Requests to work.

If not,

- On Linux, you can use the shell script to install them :
  - chmod u+x install_dep.sh
  - ./install_dep.sh

- On windows, you can use install_dep.bat but you need to have
  installed the [`pip module`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) before.

Then, from your terminal, you can type : RandoMetal.py -h

Enjoy !
