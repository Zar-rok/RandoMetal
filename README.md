# RandoMetal
Simple python script to randomly play a metal music.

[------------------------------------------------------------------]

Make sure you have BeautifulSoup4, Selenium and Requests to work.

If not, you can use the shell script to install them :
  - chmod u+x install_dep.sh
  - ./install_dep.sh

If you are on windows, you can use install_dep.bat but you need to
have installed the [`pip module`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

Then, from your terminal, you can type : RandoMetal.py -h

Enjoy !
